            <p>Viola Desmond, born on July 6, 1914, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was a trailblazing Black Canadian
              entrepreneur and civil rights activist. She defied racial segregation in 1946 when she refused to leave
              the whites-only section of a movie theatre, leading to her arrest and subsequent legal battle. Desmond's
              courageous stand against injustice sparked nationwide attention and became a symbol of resistance against
              discrimination in Canada. Her legacy as a pioneer in the fight for racial equality was solidified when she
              became the first Black Canadian woman to appear on the nation's $10 bill in 2018, cementing her enduring
              impact on Canadian history and inspiring generations to come.</p>
